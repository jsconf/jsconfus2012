The Twilio Bus will run all day from Phoenix Airport (PHX) to the Hotel Venue. If you aren't staying at the Firesky resort, it will still drop you off in the downtown Scottsdale area. When you arrive, you can find out the latest schedule update for the bus by texting: <a href="tel:9724457263">972-44-JSCNF</a> (9724457263) and it will send you a wait time estimate. Technology is awesome!</p>

		<p>NotConf is an all day, come-and-go pre-conference event for those attending JSConf and for people in the community interested in Javascript.

It is a just a <a href="http://g.co/maps/fyf4b">short walk</a> from the JSConf venue so you can get back easily. Come dressed for this rodeo, because there will be a full-on Mechanical Bull Tournament throughout the evening. Yup, try you luck to stay on the bull and see if you can beat the record and own the bragging rights for the first ever JSConf Rider Cup. Get ready to saddle up on the meanest mechanical bull in the West and try your best to tame this bucking bronco.</p>

			<h3>About JSConf</h3>
			<p>We have been doing JSConf for 4 years and every single one has been better than the last, it is something we take a great deal of pride in. We make events that aren't from the standard conference playbook because we believe you deserve more than that. We focus on two things, presenting mind-altering JavaScript technology and uses during the daytime and providing exceptional "networking events" AKA killer parties during the evenings. That sets the general schedule of events for each JSConf, but it has become so much more. We use each event to present and push the state-of-the-art in JS and the web. JSConf does not focus on what is popular or cool now, but on topics that will define and revolutionize the next year of technology. We have been the launching point for some of the most revolutionary products, services, and technologies on the web. We have made a strong and continual commitment to making JSConf small and intimate, unfortunately that means that everyone doesn't get a ticket, this year we are capping the conference at 250 attendees. We do this on purpose, we have done big events and they suck. We have been to big events, they still suck. We have sponsored big events, guess what -- yup, still sucked. Our goal is to bring the JS community together, so far it has been pretty successful at that goal. JSConf isn't like other conferences and that is very much intentional. We deeply care about our attendees, sponsors, and speakers which is why we strive to make the event both family and friend accessible with our Significant Others track, schedule the best possible content in our two tracks, embrace the HallConf style with our Hacker Lounge, and put on the craziest of parties. We aren't conference organizers, we are community curators.</p>
			<p>If you love JSConf or if you want to get to a JSConf-like event, our group puts on many other events throughout the year - check them out:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><a href="http://jsconf.eu">JSConf.EU</a></li>
			  <li><a href="http://texasjavascript.com">TXJS</a></li>

			  <li><a href="http://capitoljs.com/">CapitolJS</a></li>
			  <li><a href="http://dojoconf.com/">DojoConf</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The theme for JSConf US 2012 is "The Old West" and being set in Downtown Scottsdale is the perfect backdrop. If you have never been you are in for a treat - if you have, then you know what is in store. Cowgirl and Cowboy outfits are very much encouraged, trust us you won't be the only one wearing it.</p>
			<p>We are trying to make something different and we are trying to do it with JS.</p>
			<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
			<p>All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any JSConf event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
			
      <p><strong>The Quick Version</strong><br/>JSConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
      <p><strong>The Less Quick Version</strong><br/>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.<br/><br/>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.<br/><br/>
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.<br/><br/>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.<br/><br/>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by a clearly marked "STAFF" shirt.<br/><br/>
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.<br/><br/>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

			<h5>Daniel Henry Holmes Ingalls, Jr.</h5>
			<p>
			Daniel Henry Holmes Ingalls, Jr. is a pioneer of object-oriented computer programming and the principal architect, designer and implementor of five generations of Smalltalk environments. He designed the bytecoded virtual machine that made Smalltalk practical in 1976. He also invented Bit blit, the general-purpose graphical operation that underlies most bitmap graphics systems today, and pop-up menus. He designed the generalizations of BitBlt to arbitrary color depth, with built-in scaling, rotation, and anti-aliasing. His major contributions to the Squeak system include the original concept of a Smalltalk written in itself and made portable and efficient by a Smalltalk-to-C translator.

			<p>This cowgirl lives in Scottsdale, so the commute to JSConf is killer!  Kristin is a high stakes meeting facilitator and speaker - so you're going to experience a unique conversation about living in a high tech world. As one of the first female graduates of the United States Coast Guard Academy and the first woman stationed onboard a USCG Cutter, Kristin learned early on about working with others.  In 1990, she became one of the first USCG facilitators - and made every mistake one could!  Frustrated, she avidly researched this nascent skill called "facilitation" and found herself training a cadre of internal facilitators.  By 1992, companies were asking her to teach their people how to facilitate and lead teams!  Since then, she has been sharing her concrete approach to team building with a treasure trove of practical concepts, tools and techniques her clients can apply immediately to see positive, substantive results.  </p>

Splunk's recently released JavaScript SDK on <a href="https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-javascript">GitHub</a> takes big data to the web by working as-is for the web and Node.js enabling developers to build end-to-end big data applications completely in JavaScript.  With the JavaScript SDK developers can build visualizations with Splunk data using Google charts and other visualization tools.  Also, the standard timeline view and charting capabilities of Splunk's out-of-the-box web interface are now components that can be included in applications. <a href="http://dev.splunk.com/view/javascript-sdk/SP-CAAAECM">Learn more about the JavaScript SDK</a></p>

			<p>JSConf US 2012 is being held at the oasis in the desert known as <a href="http://www.fireskyresort.com/">the FireSky resort</a> in <a href="http://www.scottsdaledowntown.com/">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>. For those of you looking to hitch your horse, we definitely recommend staying at this fine establishment and are able to offer you the <a href="https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=26728&amp;Chain=10179&amp;arrive=4/1/2012&amp;depart=4/4/2012&amp;adult=1&amp;child=0&amp;group=11440602164">amazingly low rate of <strong>$189 USD</strong> per night</a> for super swanky accommodations. They have everything including a spa, firepits, and amazing waterholes for you go swimming in - perfect for resting off that hard trip across the plains or mountains (or the plane flight). Right in the heart of Downtown Scottsdale, everything will be within walking distance to the event OR transportation will be provided. Also all rooms at the FireSky come with free WIFI for those of you that can't just disconnect.</p>
			<h3>Getting Here</h3>
			<div id='map' style="height: 250px;"></div>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>To get to Scottsdale, AZ we recommend flying into the <a href="http://skyharbor.com/">Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport (PHX)</a>, "America's friendliest airport", as it is just 9 miles from the resort. You can <a href="http://skyharbor.com/transportationparking/limosAndTaxis.html">hop a taxi/shuttle (roughly $30)</a> or rent a car - there is free parking at the hotel for our attendees. If you can, allow for a couple days before or after the conference and take advantage of the desert by <a href="http://g.co/maps/djnd9">driving to the Grand Canyon National Park</a> and see one of the wonders of the world. If you don't want to spend 8 hours driving in a day, just take a quick trip up to the beautiful <a href="http://www.visitsedona.com/">Red Rocks of Sedona</a> which is just <a href="http://g.co/maps/b3d9j">2.5 hours away</a> and absolutely beautiful. If amazing rock formations aren't your thing, drive around the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelback_Mountain">Camelback Mountain</a> and all the super mega-homes. Either way, it is well worth the trip!</p>

<!-- 

Dear Knowledgeable JSConf visitor,

We have had quite a fun time throughout the last 4 years. We have survived 
rocky starts, pirates, dysentery, the Brendan Eich Fan Club and others. We 
have seen new stars rise and others disappear from the spotlight. Every year we
have always had some fun game for you to figure out in order to get a discount
on the ticket price. 2009, it was rather obvious, 2010, it was buried treasure,
2011, it was shooting the oxen. This year, obtaining a ticket at the original 
purchase price of a JSConf 2009 ticket can be done only if you are hip enough
to have found this before the end of January 11th. If you found this, then go 
donate at least $100 to http://www.crowdrise.com/teamjs and help fund the food
banks across the USA. It will make you feel good inside, it is a tax write-off,
and seriously it makes a big difference. Send us a copy of your receipt and we 
will send you a discount code - do it before tickets go on sale. We work very 
hard throughout the year to make JSConf special for you and all we ask is that
you help us change the world - nothing too crazy, eh? We have had a good run, 
the lot of us, we have made many good friends along the way and done some 
insane things that I personally never thought would happen at a "tech 
conference". No matter what happens in the future, thank you for being you. We
will always have JSConf. Thank you for reading the source and continuing to 
make the world a better place.

Always remember:
   What would you attempt to do, if you knew you could not fail?
