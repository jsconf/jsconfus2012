			<h3>Saddle Up! We Ride To FireSky At Dawn!</h3>
			<p>JSConf is one of the most exciting and cutting edge technical conferences ever and it's all about JS - what could be better? This year we put on our boots, saddle up our horses, and head out to that crazy little town with the epic western feel and perfect JSConf vibe, Scottsdale, Arizona! Come prepared as your curators Chris and Laura Williams pull out all the stops in the fourth edition of JSConf US. The conference itself will be held at the amazing <a href="http://www.fireskyresort.com/" target="_blank">FireSky Resort and Spa</a>, but will have parties Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday all around Scottsdale.  We are able to offer an excellent <a href="https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=26728&amp;Chain=10179&amp;arrive=4/1/2012&amp;depart=4/4/2012&amp;adult=1&amp;child=0&amp;group=11440602164">room rate of $189/night</a> at the venue where the conference is being held, sign up early as there are limited rooms available at that rate -- they will sell out. Just like every JSConf events, there will be a major focus on once-in-a-lifetime shared experiences with the best and brightest people using JS, so come prepared to cowgirl (or cowboy) up!</p>
      <p>This year we are doing <a href="http://jsconfus2012.eventbrite.com/">two ticket releases</a>, Gaucho (or early bird at $550) on January 18th, 2012 at 3:00PM Eastern Time (USA) and Buckaroo (or regular at $650) on January 25th at 3:00PM Eastern Time (USA). There are a limited number of tickets, so plan ahead and be there on time, you have been warned. If you have helped the <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/teamjs">TeamJS</a>  cause, we have a surprise for you, but you have to <a href="mailto:chris@jsconf.com">contact us</a> before January 18th with proof of your donation.  </p>
      <p>If you have any questions other than "it says sold out, can I get a ticket" or variations thereof, don't hesitate to contact your crazy leaders for this journey, <a href="mailto:chris@jsconf.com">Chris Williams</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/voodootikigod">@voodootikigod</a>)</p>

			<h3>About JSConf</h3>
			<p>We have been doing JSConf for 4 years and every single one has been better than the last, it is something we take a great deal of pride in. We make events that aren't from the standard conference playbook because we believe you deserve more than that. We focus on two things, presenting mind-altering JavaScript technology and uses during the daytime and providing exceptional "networking events" AKA killer parties during the evenings. That sets the general schedule of events for each JSConf, but it has become so much more. We use each event to present and push the state-of-the-art in JS and the web. JSConf does not focus on what is popular or cool now, but on topics that will define and revolutionize the next year of technology. We have been the launching point for some of the most revolutionary products, services, and technologies on the web. We have made a strong and continual commitment to making JSConf small and intimate, unfortunately that means that everyone doesn't get a ticket, this year we are capping the conference at 250 attendees. We do this on purpose, we have done big events and they suck. We have been to big events, they still suck. We have sponsored big events, guess what -- yup, still sucked. Our goal is to bring the JS community together, so far it has been pretty successful at that goal. JSConf isn't like other conferences and that is very much intentional. We deeply care about our attendees, sponsors, and speakers which is why we strive to make the event both family and friend accessible with our Significant Others track, schedule the best possible content in our two tracks, embrace the HallConf style with our Hacker Lounge, and put on the craziest of parties. We aren't conference organizers, we are community curators.</p>
			<p>If you love JSConf or if you want to get to a JSConf-like event, our group puts on many other events throughout the year - check them out:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><a href="http://jsconf.eu">JSConf.EU</a></li>
			  <li><a href="http://texasjavascript.com">TXJS</a></li>
			  <li><a href="http://www.nodeconf.com">NodeConf</a></li>
			  <li><a href="http://capitoljs.com/">CapitolJS</a></li>
			  <li><a href="http://dojoconf.com/">DojoConf</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The theme for JSConf US 2012 is "The Old West" and being set in Downtown Scottsdale is the perfect backdrop. If you have never been you are in for a treat - if you have, then you know what is in store. Cowgirl and Cowboy outfits are very much encouraged, trust us you won't be the only one wearing it.</p>
			<p>We are trying to make something different and we are trying to do it with JS.</p>
			<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
			<p>All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any JSConf event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
			
      <p><strong>The Quick Version</strong><br/>JSConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
      <p><strong>The Less Quick Version</strong><br/>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.<br/><br/>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.<br/><br/>
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.<br/><br/>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.<br/><br/>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by a clearly marked "STAFF" shirt.<br/><br/>
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.<br/><br/>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

	  <h3>Speakers - We Are Corralling Them!</h3>
	  <p>At JSConf, we like to experiment and try new things out - but you already knew that. The standard conference call for speakers process is relatively broken and seems to yield the same batch of speakers presenting the same batch of talks. That is not cool. We want to change this and so we are trying out a new process. Instead of relying on people to raise their hands to speak, we are asking you - the potential JSConf audience who you would want to see and hear speak at JSConf. We are doing this to build the list of potential speakers from which we will curate based on our <a href="http://voodootikigod.com/how-i-pick-speakers-for-jsconf">previously defined processes</a>.</p><p>If you want to speak, submit yourself by all means! If you want to see someone from another language speak, submit their name (and if you have contact info, even better!) If you just have a topic, submit that. Anything goes. We do want to make it abundantly clear, the speakers are not decided based on popularity, so submitting yourself a billion times does not help you.  We will be accepting submissions until January 15th, so submit early and submit often, there is no harm in telling us who you want to see - if anything its to your benefit.

    <p>Once we have the list assembled, we will curate the final list, and then track down the individuals and invite them to speak at JSConf. Remember, JSConf is targeting the future and willing to show off risky talks (see: <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>, <a href="http://paulirish.com/work/gordon/demos/">Gordon</a>) and we love crazy ideas, so plan accordingly.</p>
    <p>Do you have someone or something you have been hoping to see at a JSConf? Please submit to our 
	  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGVjdTZIQkdwQXUtWmRkQmRVeTdwVWc6MQ">Call for Speakers</a> before January 15<sup>th</sup>. We will need about two weeks to send out invites to the lucky individuals</p>

			<p>JSConf US 2012 is being held at the oasis in the desert known as <a href="http://www.fireskyresort.com/">the FireSky resort</a> in <a href="http://www.scottsdaledowntown.com/">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>. For those of you looking to hitch your horse, we definitely recommend staying at this fine establishment and are able to offer you the <a href="https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=26728&amp;Chain=10179&amp;arrive=4/1/2012&amp;depart=4/4/2012&amp;adult=1&amp;child=0&amp;group=11440602164">amazingly low rate of <strong>$189 USD</strong> per night</a> for super swanky accommodations. They have everything including a spa, firepits, and amazing waterholes for you go swimming in - perfect for resting off that hard trip across the plains or mountains (or the plane flight). Right in the heart of Downtown Scottsdale, everything will be within walking distance to the event OR transportation will be provided. Also all rooms at the FireSky come with free WIFI for those of you that can't just disconnect.</p>
			<h3>Getting Here</h3>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>To get to Scottsdale, AZ we recommend flying into the <a href="http://skyharbor.com/">Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport (PHX)</a>, "America's friendliest airport", as it is just 9 miles from the resort. You can <a href="http://skyharbor.com/transportationparking/limosAndTaxis.html">hop a taxi/shuttle (roughly $30)</a> or rent a car - there is free parking at the hotel for our attendees. If you can, allow for a couple days before or after the conference and take advantage of the desert by <a href="http://g.co/maps/djnd9">driving to the Grand Canyon National Park</a> and see one of the wonders of the world. If you don't want to spend 8 hours driving in a day, just take a quick trip up to the beautiful <a href="http://www.visitsedona.com/">Red Rocks of Sedona</a> which is just <a href="http://g.co/maps/b3d9j">2.5 hours away</a> and absolutely beautiful. If amazing rock formations aren't your thing, drive around the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelback_Mountain">Camelback Mountain</a> and all the super mega-homes. Either way, it is well worth the trip!</p>

<!-- 

Dear Knowledgeable JSConf visitor,

We have had quite a fun time throughout the last 4 years. We have survived 
rocky starts, pirates, dysentery, the Brendan Eich Fan Club and others. We 
have seen new stars rise and others disappear from the spotlight. Every year we
have always had some fun game for you to figure out in order to get a discount
on the ticket price. 2009, it was rather obvious, 2010, it was buried treasure,
2011, it was shooting the oxen. This year, obtaining a ticket at the original 
purchase price of a JSConf 2009 ticket can be done only if you are hip enough
to have found this before the end of January 11th. If you found this, then go 
donate at least $100 to http://www.crowdrise.com/teamjs and help fund the food
banks across the USA. It will make you feel good inside, it is a tax write-off,
and seriously it makes a big difference. Send us a copy of your receipt and we 
will send you a discount code - do it before tickets go on sale. We work very 
hard throughout the year to make JSConf special for you and all we ask is that
you help us change the world - nothing too crazy, eh? We have had a good run, 
the lot of us, we have made many good friends along the way and done some 
insane things that I personally never thought would happen at a "tech 
conference". No matter what happens in the future, thank you for being you. We
will always have JSConf. Thank you for reading the source and continuing to 
make the world a better place.

Always remember:
   What would you attempt to do, if you knew you could not fail?
